        "- An interpreted language is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.The interpreter takes the source code and converts it into machine code dynamically while the program is running. There is no separate \"compiled\" output.\n",
        "Ex : Python,javascript,ruby\n",
        "\n",
        "- A compiled language is translated directly into machine code (binary code) by a compiler before execution. The compiler takes the entire source code, processes it, and creates an executable file.After compilation, the program can be run without the need for the original source code or a compiler.\n",

        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging records the state anf=d flow of your program and show how the program behaves overtime. It is useful for understanding , monitorinf and debugging of your code.\n",

        "\n",
        " 10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - Logging helps in debugging the program, better understaning of program flow , easier trouble shooting etc.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in Python refers to the process of managing and allocating memory for objects and data structures during the execution of a Python program. Python, like most programming languages, manages memory automatically, but it also provides developers with mechanisms to optimize and track memory usage. This ensures that memory is used efficiently and that resources are released when they are no longer needed.\n",
